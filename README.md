Luddo (also known as Ludo) is a board game commonly played throughout South Asia.

Without following the full rules, here is a simple version of luddo made using C++ and the windowing toolkit FLTK.

This program can be built in Linux if the FLTK library can be found at 'usr/local/lib' and the header files under 'usr/local/include'

Type 'make' in the terminal to build, then 'make run' to begin the application.
